# **Song Playlist Application (LinkedList Project)**

This project demonstrates the use of a **Singly Linked List** in Java to manage a **song playlist**.
It allows users to **add**, **delete**, **search**, **display**, **count**, **reverse**, **play next**, and **clear** songs in the playlist through a **console-based menu**.

The project focuses on practicing **linked list operations** with a custom `Playlist` and `Song` class.
