# Student Manager (ArrayList Project)

This project demonstrates the use of **ArrayList** in Java to manage student records.  
It allows adding students with their names and grades, updating their grades, searching for specific students, displaying all records, and removing students from the list.

The project is menu-driven and focuses on practicing basic operations of Java Collections with a custom `Student` class.
